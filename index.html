            <p id="apodText">"The stars are not alone.  In the disk of our Milky Way Galaxy about 10 percent of visible
                 matter is in the form of gas, called the interstellar medium (ISM).  The ISM is not uniform, and shows
                  patchiness even near our Sun.  It can be quite difficult to detect the local ISM because it is so
                   tenuous and emits so little light. This mostly hydrogen gas, however, absorbs some very specific
                    colors that can be detected in the light of the nearest stars.  A working map of the local ISM within
                     20 light-years, based on ongoing observations and recent particle detections from the Earth-orbiting
                      Interstellar Boundary Exporer satellite  (IBEX), is shown above.  These observations indicate that
                       our Sun is moving through a Local Interstellar Cloud as this cloud flows outwards from the
                        Scorpius-Centaurus Association star forming region.  Our Sun may exit the Local Cloud, also called
                         the Local Fluff, during the next 10,000 years.  Much remains unknown about the local ISM, including
                          details of its distribution, its origin, and how it affects the Sun and the Earth. Unexpectedly,
                           recent IBEX spacecraft measurements indicate that the direction from which neutral interstellar
                            particles flow through our Solar System is changing.</p>
